# About ShockWallet

Share your node with friends, family, apps, and customers over Nostr with [shockwallet.app](https://shockwallet.app)

## ⚡ A revolutionary Lightning Wallet for connecting to nodes over Nostr. ⚡

Mobile nodes have proven slow and unreliable, fake Layer 2's that rely on centralized swaps from Lightning gateways are expensive, and opening a channel to every app and device is cost prohibitive and unscalable. Both solutions still don't let you receive payments while offline trustlessly. 

Sharing an always-online self-custodial node with friends and family, the "Uncle Jim" method, has lacked adequate tooling to simplify networking and account setup... until now.

ShockWallet is the first wallet to use Nostr based accounts for Lightning Network connections, providing a new, open, and secure way to connect to the Lightning Network.

Additionally, ShockWallet supports connecting to multiple-nodes simultaneously, and is leading the way in automation by allowing you setup recurring payments or pre-authorize external applications or services requesting a payment. 

As a Nostr-native wallet, ShockWallet provides [multi-device sync abilities](https://x.com/shocknet_justin/status/1823111069486735530) via NIP78, enabling for example a shared wallet state between a Desktop and Phone. 

We're also pushing the boundries of Nostr and Lightning integration with [CLINK](https://github.com/shocknet/CLINK) that create more secure app connections with better UX than is currently available.

**For new users, an optional Bootstrap node is default on mainnet allowing for the lay-away of a self-custodied channel for your own node with a partner LSP.** [*Service subject to Terms*](https://docs.shock.network/terms)
