# About

Hi,

We’re shocknet and we make open-source, decentralized apps for the Bitcoin Lightning Network, using Nostr.

We also provide hosting services to use them with, like a CDN(Content Delivery Network) for sharing video, and professional relays for Nostr.

By using our services, you’ll help us to keep improving the software to build a powerful Bitcoin circular economy. We look forward to serving you!

-The Shock Team
