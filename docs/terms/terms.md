# Terms

By using shocknet services you acknowledge and agree to these terms of use, which could change without notice.

Shock Network, Inc. is based proudly in the United States, and is bound to comply with laws therein. 

## Abuse

Unlawful or otherwise dangerous use of our services will be terminated without warning or recompense, and referred to law enforcement if appropriate. This includes but is not limited to the uploading of criminally vile content.

Denial of Service attacks, either on or from our infrastructure, will not be tolerated.

Copyright claimants should send applicable evidence to any of our contact methods for prompt assistance.

Bootstrap access is a temporary mechanism for procuring ShockNet infrastructure prior to full deployment. Credits issued in this mode are non-redeemable, non-transferable, and may only be used toward ShockNet services. They are subject to strict value limits and are permanently closed upon use, in accordance with CFPB guidance on limited-purpose prepaid funding. Attempts to circumvent these limits—via self-refunding, indirect transfers, or other workarounds—are prohibited and may result in account termination.

## Privacy

As a Bitcoin-native cloud hosting provider we have no need to collect any PII. Even email addresses are optional. 

Also,

    * We do not use ad networks.
    * We do not sell data of any kind.
    * We only log what is relevant to our own infrastructure.
    * We only use cookies or browser storage for application state.

We do leverage some 3rd parties for non-personalized useage metrics, as well as datacenter services. It is possible they use metadata as your ISP or browser might.

## Use at your own risk

Our applications and infrastructure are on the bleeding edge of decentralized and open-source technologies, and the internet is a dynamic and adversarial environment.

While we always give our best effort in making what we publish secure, reliable and reasonably private, we make no guarantees and bear no responsibility for losses that may result from it failing to meet your expectations.

## Fees

We provide infrastructure services including bandwidth, storage, compute, name-space, and network utilities. These are sold in granular units and prepaid using Bitcoin, primarily via the Lightning Network.

As a hosting provider, we do not keep a percentage of monetization revenues on content served from our infrastructure. Our self-custodial monetization tools are sustained through integrated network services, including CDN, Transcoding, Relay, and VM hosting.

Fees vary from service to service and are based on market conditions for Bitcoin relative to datacenter resources. See our [Fee Table](https://docs.shock.network/fee_table.json)

Refunds or withdrawals on change from service credits are subject to network enforced routing or chain fees.

## Censorship

We are not beholden to Ad-Networks, Bankers, NGO's, or other external influences that demand censorship of lawful free-speech.

We use WebApps wherever possible to limit exposure to Google and Apple Store policies.

Extending of reach through curated feeds is ultimately at the discretion of the curator.
